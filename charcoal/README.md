# Charcoal

This repository is intended to contain the wood charcoal database presented in Maruyama, T., Oliveira, L. S., Britto Jr, Nisgoski, S., Automatic Classification of Native Wood Charcoal, Ecological Informatics, 48:1-7, 2018.

The dataset is available [here](https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/charcoal/) and contains 44 forest species which were cataloged by the Laboratory of Wood Anatomy at the Federal University of Parana in Curitiba, Brazil. 

### Acquisition description

The trees were cut in a natural forest, and disks were extracted from the diameter at breast height (DBH), with a thickness of about 8 cm. Twelve samples were obtained from each species, with dimensions of 2 X 2 X 5 cm. Each sample was wrapped in aluminum foil and carbonized in a muffle furnace (Q318S, Quimis), with a final temperature of 450 Celsius and a heating rate of 1.66 Celsius min−1. The carbonized material remained at the final temperature for two hours. The images were obtained directly from the carbonized material, without coating, with a tabletop microscope (TM-1000, Hitachi).

The images were stored in TIFF (Tagged Image File) format with no compression and resolution of 1280 × 1040 pixels.
